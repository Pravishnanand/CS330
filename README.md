**How do I approach designing software?**
When designing software, my approach centers around iterative development and problem-solving, allowing for flexibility and continuous improvement as the project evolves. In my CS 330 project, I enhanced my design skills by focusing on real-time debugging and refining algorithms to optimize performance, which was crucial in the context of the 3D graphics work we were undertaking. Instead of starting with extensive planning and documentation, I adopted a more agile process, where I began with a basic prototype and incrementally added features, testing each one thoroughly before moving on. This iterative, hands-on approach helped me to quickly identify and address issues, ensuring that the final design was both functional and efficient. These tactics, such as starting small and building complexity over time, can be incredibly useful in future projects, especially when working with unfamiliar technologies or when project requirements are likely to evolve. This experience has taught me the value of flexibility and the importance of being able to adapt my design strategies as new challenges arise.

**How do I approach developing programs?**
In developing programs, I prioritize a strategy that combines careful planning with iterative development, allowing for continuous refinement and improvement of the codebase. While working on my 3D scene, I employed new development strategies such as implementing a component-based architecture, which enabled me to isolate and refine individual features without disrupting the overall system. Iteration played a critical role in my development process; I frequently revisited and revised my code based on testing results and feedback, which helped me to steadily improve the performance and visual quality of the scene. My approach to developing code evolved significantly throughout the milestones of the project. Initially, I focused on getting basic functionality in place, but as I progressed, I became more adept at optimizing and refactoring my code to improve efficiency and readability. This iterative, feedback-driven approach not only led to the successful completion of the project but also reinforced the importance of flexibility and continuous improvement in software development.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computer science, particularly in the realm of computational graphics and visualizations, has provided me with a wealth of new knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to my future educational and professional pathways. Through working with computational graphics, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate data visually, which is a valuable skill in fields such as data science, game development, and virtual reality. These skills have enhanced my ability to create intuitive and engaging visual representations of complex data, a capability that is increasingly in demand in today's data-driven world. Professionally, the ability to develop sophisticated visualizations opens up new opportunities in industries like entertainment, simulation, and education, where interactive and immersive experiences are key. By mastering these techniques, I am better equipped to tackle complex problems in my career, bringing creative and technical solutions to the forefront of my work.
